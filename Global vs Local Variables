""" Information
Create a global variable: Start by defining a global variable outside any function. 
Name it global_var and set it to a string value, e.g., "I am global!".
Define a function: Create a function called print_variables(). Inside this function:
Print the global variable global_var.
Define a local variable named local_var and set it to a string value, e.g., "I am local!".
Print the local variable local_var.
Call the function: After defining the function, call print_variables() to see the output.
Try to access local variable: Outside of the function, try to print local_var. 
Observe what happens.
